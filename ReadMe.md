## Introduction 

The final project for Info 550 is an opportunity for students to showcase the 
data science skills learned through the semester. While data reproducibility 
is the primary goal of the project, there are three components that are required.

1. Data manipulation
2. Data analysis
3. Report writing

The data I have chosen to work with comes from the 2020 NFL Big Data bowl.
Every year, the NFL puts on a ‘data bowl’ for armature sports analysts. In 2020, 
their challenge was using player tracking data to predict how many yards will 
an NFL player gain after receiving a handoff. This data set contains are 49 
variables and 682154 observations. The data spans between the 2017-2019 season.


Through this project, I hope to utilize both skills learned in this course, and 
integrate some sports analytics packages into my report. We'll see though.

## Report Generation
In the terminal, type "make" and the final report will be generated.My make file is working. Currently, my final_report.Rmd file has not been put together. I have been working out of the wk4_deliverable.Rmd.

As of right now, I have four R scripts in my code folder. The first one (01_rushing_plays.R) is me trying to make a table. The code worked in the R chunk in a .rmd file, but now I can't figure out how to make the r script export into a useable output that I can generate into my final report. 

The second r script (02_plot_height_weight.R) plots out the hight and weight of the players in this data set. It creates an output that goes into the figures folder. In the .rmd file, it knits in the figure that's created. 

I don't know what my third figure will be exactly, but the code 03_make_output3.R is the current placeholder.
